<h1 id="howtocontribute">How to contribute</h1>

<p>Swiper loves to welcome your contributions. There are several ways to help out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an <a href="https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/issues">issue</a> on GitHub, if you have found a bug</li>
<li>Write test cases or provide examples for open bug issues</li>
<li>Write patches for open bug/feature issues</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we have a
chance of keeping on top of things.</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">GitHub account</a>.</li>
<li>Submit an <a href="https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/issues">issue</a>, assuming one does not already exist.</li>
<li> Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.</li>
<li> Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.</li>
<li>Fork the repository on GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="makingchanges">Making Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.</li>
<li> This is usually the master branch.</li>
<li> Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
branch.</li>
<li> To quickly create a topic branch based on master; <code>git branch
master/my_contribution master</code> then checkout the new branch with <code>git
checkout master/my_contribution</code>. Better avoid working directly on the
<code>master</code> branch, to avoid conflicts if you pull in updates from origin.</li>
<li>Make commits of logical units.</li>
<li>Check for unnecessary whitespace with <code>git diff --check</code> before committing.</li>
<li>Use descriptive commit messages and reference the #issue number.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submittingchanges">Submitting Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request to the repository</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="editorconfig">Editor Config</h2>

<p>The project uses .editorconfig to define the coding style of each file. We recommend that you install the Editor Config extension for your preferred IDE.</p>
